okay so the plan for this folder and the way to make this overlay is as follows

1)in this folder:
    - typescript for getting acces to google sheets on client account
    - typescript for getting and setting values
    - using objects? asa data blocks in the sence that either the entire dokument gets loaded into a object to parse to other places
        - will depend on what we get from google sheets 
        - 1 obejct for all data or a obejct per item
            - in that case the sets will be a object with objects
    - using json if we can get it from the google sheets

    but basiclly this folder is for handeling google sheets

2)make a auto fill table that take the data from what ever we get from step 1

(step 3 & 4 might have to lay in the ingame folder or the ingame.ts)
3) make logic for inputing the price
4) make logic for buttons buy and sell
